    "input": "Customer confused about interest rate terminology",
    "output": "Per Annum (p.a.) means the interest rate charged per year.\n\nExample:\n- Rate: 12% p.a.\n- Loan Amount: INR 1 lakh\n- For 1 year: Interest = INR 1,00,000 × 12 ÷ 100 = INR 12,000\n- For 1 month: Interest = INR 12,000 ÷ 12 = INR 1,000\n\nHow it affects EMI:\n- Monthly rate = Annual rate ÷ 12\n- 12% p.a. = 1% per month\n- Higher p.a. rate = Higher monthly EMI\n- Lower p.a. rate = Lower monthly EMI\n\nImportant:\n- EMI includes both principal and interest\n- Interest portion decreases over time (more principal in later EMIs)\n- Total interest = (EMI × months) - Principal amount\n\nTip: Lower p.a. rates save significant money over loan tenure."
