    "content": "\nEMI (Equated Monthly Installment) Formula:\nEMI = [P × R × (1 + R)^N] / [(1 + R)^N - 1]\n\nWhere:\n- P = Principal loan amount (in rupees)\n- R = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100)\n- N = Total number of months (loan tenure in years × 12)\n\nExample Calculation:\nPrincipal (P) = INR 5,00,000\nAnnual Rate = 10% p.a.\nTenure = 5 years (60 months)\n\nStep 1: Calculate monthly rate\nR = 10 ÷ 12 ÷ 100 = 0.008333\n\nStep 2: Apply formula\nEMI = [5,00,000 × 0.008333 × (1.008333)^60] / [(1.008333)^60 - 1]\nEMI = [4166.67 × 1.6453] / [0.6453]\nEMI = INR 10,610 per month\n\nTotal Payment = 10,610 × 60 = INR 6,36,600\nTotal Interest = 6,36,600 - 5,00,000 = INR 1,36,600\n\nImportant Notes:\n- EMI remains constant throughout the loan period\n- First EMI installment due after 30 days from disbursement\n- EMI includes both principal and interest\n- Prepayment reduces both total interest and remaining tenure\n"

    "content": "\nUnderstanding Interest Component in Each EMI:\n\nEarly EMIs (First 6 months):\n- Higher interest component\n- Lower principal component\n- Example: In first EMI of INR 10,000, interest might be INR 4,167, principal only INR 5,833\n\nMiddle EMIs (6-36 months):\n- Gradual decrease in interest component\n- Gradual increase in principal component\n- More principal is paid off\n\nFinal EMIs (Last 12 months):\n- Lower interest component\n- Higher principal component\n- Majority goes toward principal repayment\n\nExample Breakdown - INR 5L at 10% for 5 years:\nMonth 1: Interest = 4,166.67 | Principal = 6,443.33 | Balance = 4,93,556.67\nMonth 12: Interest = 3,953.68 | Principal = 6,656.32 | Balance = 4,20,598.68\nMonth 30: Interest = 2,827.45 | Principal = 7,782.55 | Balance = 2,17,842.19\nMonth 59: Interest = 87.58 | Principal = 10,522.42 | Balance = 10,087.58\nMonth 60: Interest = 84.06 | Principal = 10,525.94 | Balance = 0\n\nKey Insight:\nEarly prepayment saves maximum interest.
